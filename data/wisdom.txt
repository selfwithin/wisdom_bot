Sunny King and Scott Nadal invented Peercoin in August 2012 as the first Proof of Stake secured cryptocurrency. #Genesis
Peercoin’s blockchain security rests entirely on PoS.  PoW mining is used only to generate a fair initial coin distribution. #fair #security
ICOs create central points of failure for Proof of Stake systems. Peercoin has been fairly distributing coins since 2012. #fair #OG
Peercoin was first to implement a dust limit, fee burning, fixed fees, a coherent inflation rate, oh yah and Proof of Stake. #OG #pioneer
While Peercoin’s inflation due to PoS is only ~1%, a continuous minter currently gets around 5%/year rewards. #sustainability
The mint reward rate is related to a) how many coins are participating, and b) the mint difficulty. Time is the difference. #participation
Time is the expended commodity in PoS networks. Afterall, isn’t time the only thing we truly have to offer? #deepthoughts
Peercoin strives to survive as an immutable record. The moon is just a side trip. #immutability
Opportunity cost is real. Peercoin atrophies its attackers with its mere existence. #survive
PoS inflation can be seen as a nominal ‘in name only’ interest because anyone can participate. #accessible
The Peercoin DAO is more than the blockchain, it is all of us at the moment of our most caring. #voluntary
The PoS reward is in two parts, a 3%/year coinage part, and ~1.25 PPC/block static part. #minting
Peercoin inflation is around half PoS and half PoW. Distribution is #hybrid, while security is 100% #PoS. 
PoW block rewards go down when PoW difficulty goes up in Peercoin. 16x difficulty cuts the reward in half. #sustainable
Self-governance is a core attribute of PoS. Combined with fair distribution, Peercoin sets the bar for #justice in economics.
Deflationary cryptocurrencies are doomed to fail once their block rewards run out. #Sustainability is multi-faceted.
While the Foundation allows for #accountability and a way to centralize efforts, Peercoin thrives off volunteers.
PeerAssets is a #tokenization protocol designed to be lightweight to fit on an #efficient chain like Peercoin.
With a ~1GB blockchain, Peercoin’s #efficiency allows for a true peer-to-peer protocol. Full nodes for all.
Peercoin has a fee of 0.01 PPC/KB, no calculators required. #simple
Backbone settlement layers with long-term distributed #consensus are proven over #time.
Time: it’s not just for clocks anymore. #Peercoin
Ever hear the phrase ‘time is money’? Ok, now multiply them together. #coinage
Distributed consensus allows for collections of individuals to find common ground, and to walk away. #voluntary
#Protocol changes occur when innovation is implemented. #Design starts with discussion of ideas and moves to an RFC.
Talk is cheap, so come do a lot of it with us. #Adaptability to new ideas is key.
It’s not easy being #green.
Great care has been put into keeping #decentralized projects decentralized. New coins on the block don’t get that.
Fees are #burned in Peercoin rather than recycled, keeping the blockchain tight and #efficient.
You will be #outlasted by the sunrise and by Peercoin.
Only three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and the next Peercoin block. #reliability
Outputs start to have a chance to #mint at 30 days old and reach maximum mint #probability at 90 days.
Each output to a transaction is a lottery ticket to #mint. The #timestamp of the formed block chooses the winners.
The standard client will #split outputs in two that mint earlier than 90 days.
What is the ideal output size to maximize mint rewards? It depends on the PoS #difficulty, but around 20-200 #PPC is fine.
Many Peercoin point upgrades are #hardforks, allowing the protocol to truly improve and flaunting the strength of our #consensus.
Democratically self-governed, Peercoin does not fear those who have not put in the time. #trust
Peercoin is the Eye of Agamotto. #DrStrange
#Development on Peercoin has been two-fold: maintaining #compatibility with Bitcoin code, and building our own #unique mechanisms.
Our full nodes are #streamlined enough to fit on a Raspberry Pi, a small computer, or an Internet of Things device.

The ‘Export’ button in the ‘Transactions’ tab outputs a .csv of your activities. Peercoin #Analytics aims help interpret it.
The testnet is a #mirror network with faster protocol parameters that we release updates on first to #troubleshoot them.
While #testnet coins are not worth money, being a reliable minter on the testnet helps the whole #ecosystem. 
When minting, you #hash the block and its timestamp (1 hash/utxo/second), and compare to the difficulty per unit #coinage.
Difficulty throttled PoW rewards prevent the snowballing of #energy consumption due to mining.
Outputs have a minimum size called the ‘dust limit’ which prevents #spam. It is a widely used Peercoin invention.
Rather than relying on a #feemarket and a blocksize limit, Peercoin uses a fixed fee rate to give #value to data.
You can provably #burn Peercoin simply by including a higher fee than is required. Fees are burnt.
Distributed consensus is all about strangers on the internet #agreeing. It’s nothing short of a #miracle.
OP_RETURN is a specially marked output that allows for #arbitrary data inclusion in a block, up to a limit, paying required fees.
The economics of Peercoin are uniquely defined around the act of #participation in the consensus process.
Around 7000 out of 12000 coins are PoS, intellectual #progeny of Peercoin. Even high cap coins like ETH wanna be us.
If Peercoin consumed as much #energy as Bitcoin, the price would have to be $400k/ppc with a #marketcap of $11 trillion.
The PoW component of Peercoin is made to taper off as the #efficiency of computer hardware gets better.
Every transaction ever performed is stored redundantly as an #immutable record on every full node. #transparency
Cryptocurrency is pseudo-anonymous. Many find that scary, but the battle of virtual #psuedoanonymity is #nuanced.
The agility of our love can help overcome obstacles that would otherwise be insurmountable. #hope  Wait, what am I supposed to be talking about again?
Peercoin is basically #Chronos.
A #stitch in time saves nine Peercoin.
Get me some of that green green. #efficient #money
Crypto is always greener on the other side of the proof. #proofofstake
I feel like I should be distributing leaflets. #prosthelytizing #leaf
Put that in your pipe and smoke it. #GreenCrypto
Staking is priviledge of those who hold the premine. But not with Peercoin! #proofofstake #staking
